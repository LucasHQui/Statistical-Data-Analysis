Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can analyze the data:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure the data is clean and ready for analysis. Check for any missing or inconsistent data.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate basic statistics for each plan such as the average number of calls, messages, and revenue per user.

3. **Data Visualization**: Create charts to visualize the distribution of calls, messages, and revenue for each plan.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Perform statistical tests to determine if the differences in revenue between the two plans are statistically significant.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the results, draw conclusions about which plan generates more revenue.
